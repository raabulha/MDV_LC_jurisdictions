# Unofficial Jurisdictional Boundaries of Local Councils as per Maldives Decentralization Act 24/2019

This repository holds unofficial digital maps of jurisdictional boundaries of Local Island and City Councils published through several Presidential decrees, as per Maldives Decentralization Act 24/2019. At least 5 Decrees have been published since the initial (2020/2, Government Gazette, Vol. 49, No. 44), with some minor and major changes to jurisdictional boundary of some local councils. These changes are reflected in this dataset, up to 15th September 2021 (see details below). I intend to keep track of any future changes, and update the map files in this repository, with change logs - until official GIS compatible shapefiles are released. 

The boundary lines are drawn from geo-referenced pdf maps, provided with each Presidential decree. The boundary lines should approximately match, though are not exact, as these are drawn from pdf maps. However, in the absence of digital GIS compatible map files, this could be a useful public dataset. The dataset is not prepared to be used for legal or navigational purposes, but with the intention of facilitating scientific, educational and research exercises. 

### Presidential decrees that declared/changed Local council's jurisdictional boundary

* [2020/2 - Government Gazette, Vol. 49, No. 44, 15th March 2020)](https://www.gazette.gov.mv/gazette/download/5697): This is the first Decree that established jurisdictional boundaries for local councils. 
* [2020/3 - (Government Gazette, Vol. 49, No. 53, 18th March 2020)](https://www.gazette.gov.mv/gazette/download/5706): This amended the Decree 2020/2, three days after the first decree was published. With this decree, jurisdictional boundaries of all councils were again published - and some boundaries must have changed between the two. As 2020/3 had boundaries for all council, pdf maps that came with this decree were used as the primary for digitizing boundary maps and further changes were made following subsequent decrees. 
* [2020/4 - (Government Gazette, Vol. 49, No. 184, 3rd September 2020)](https://www.gazette.gov.mv/gazette/download/5837): This amended a specific case of 2020/3, by including N. Holhumeedhoo within the jurisdictional boundary of N. Holhudhoo
* [2021/2 - (Government Gazette, Vol. 50, No. 124, 28th April 2021)](https://www.gazette.gov.mv/gazette/download/6073): This amended a specific case of 2020/3, by excluding L. Thun'buri from the jurisdictional boundary of L. Dhan'bidhoo
* [2021/4 - (Government Gazette, Vol. 50, No. 248, 25th August 2021)](https://www.gazette.gov.mv/gazette/download/6197): This decree excludes R. Gaaun'doodhoo from the jurisdictional boundary of R. Hulhudhuffaaru.
* [2021/5 - (Government Gazette, Vol. 50, No. 252 - 29the August 2021)](https://www.gazette.gov.mv/gazette/download/6201): This decree excludes part of HA. Filladhoo - named Dhapparu, from the jurisdictional boundary of HA. Filladhoo
